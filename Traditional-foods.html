                <h2>Dham</h2>
                
                <p>Dhaam is a traditional food of himachal pradesh that along with a great taste promises a healthy dose of nutrients. 
                    The dish includes dal, rajma, rice, curd, boor ki Kadi and is very well complemented with gur (jaggery).

                   <h2>Siddu</h2>
                <p>Made from wheat flour, Sidu is a local side- dish of Himachal Pradesh which greatly complements the main course of mutton or some vegetables. 
                    The preparation of Sidu is difficult and time-consuming, but for the taste that it renders, every minute of preparation is worth it.
                     The wheat flour is kept for 4-5 hours for the yeast to settle down. Later, the dough is filled with fat and put on the direct flame to get the half-cooked dough. 
                     This partly cooked dough is then steamed to keep the taste and nutrients of the ingredients intact. 
                    Sidu can easily be found in the local restaurants of Himachal Pradesh to give tourists a flavour of Himachali cuisine.</p>

                    <h2>Babru</h2>
                <p>Himachal have added a unique twist to popular Kachoris of North India. 
                    Babru is a flat bread which is prepared with the stuffing of black gram paste which is added to the kneaded dough. 
                    The crisp and the scrumptious taste that this dish has to offer will make you forget the conventional Kachoris of North India. 
                    Babru is best enjoyed with Tamarind chutney and it also complements the famous Chana Madra of Himachal cuisine.</p>

                      <h2>AKTORI</h2>
                      <p>Aktori is a local Himachali cuisine made from buckwheat flour. 
                        It is like a pancake, cooked with yogurt and spices. Often prepared during festivals or special occasions, Aktori is served with Chutney or Ghee.
                         The use of buckwheat makes it a healthy and energy-boosting meal, especially popular in the colder regions(Lahaul – Spiti) of Himachal Pradesh.</p>
